<h1>Description</h1>
<br>
The Prediction method used here is 'Linear Regrassion'. This Python's script predict adequate price for a given car. As a data source for training the model and for testing the model , It uses real offers from the website by web scrapping. Web scrapping means copying required info from the webpage using the python script.
Basically , Web Scrapping is Illegal. Here I have used 'bs4' for Web Scrapping only for educational purpose. The main objective of this project is to learn and implement the python code to train machines, that will automate various manual work.
